ahimsadb
========

The interface by which all requests to the public record are made. 
Under the hood it is just a sqlite database. 
This is used by [ahimsarest](https://github.com/NSkelsey/ahimsarest). 
Eventually [ahimsad](https://github.com/NSkelsey/ahimsad) and a desktop client will also use this library!
