/*
package peg contains the binary data for the first block in the public record.

The file rawblk.go was generated using jteeuwen's go-bindata program. This was used to simplify the import of what would otherwise be one large binary file that had to exist outside of the ombfullnode's binary.

The command below generates the 'binblk.go' file.
```
$ go-bindata -pkg="peg" -o binblk.go new-year-blk.dat
```
